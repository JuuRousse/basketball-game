Task description:
Create a basketball court with a moving ball and scoreboard. By default, the ball position should be at the center of the court. Below the basketball court should be a scoreboard with the current score of team A and team B. If you click somewhere on the court the ball goes to that position. There is a basketball backboard with the hoop on each side of the court. You should establish a scoring zone there (15x15px). If you click on that zone, should be dispatched a custom event, that handled by notification. The scoreboard should show a notification message, with the team, that scores that goal and change the current score. After the 3 seconds, notifications should fade away.
